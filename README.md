> [Some] scientist and engineers seek absolutes in scientific writing; they mistakenly treat scientific writing as a science instead of a craft.

## Four major constraints
- Audience
- Format (of the document)
- Mechanics (of the document)
- Politics (of the document)

### Audience
-  Efficiency is key
    -  Convey the most information in the least amount of **reading time**.
        -  Avoid saving the best for last, instead position key points so they're quickly noticed.
    -  Build a bridge to your audience with language, examples and analogies.
-  If your audience is a mix of managers and technical experts, decide which is the primary audience.
    -  One way to cope with a mixed audience is to write the document body for the more general audience while using footnotes and back matter to fill in the details for technical experts.
-  Use the concept of emphasis (and lack of emphasis) to highlight important points.
-  Facts alone are not enough, tell the story. It's not lying or dishonest, rather it's crucial for connecting with your audience.
-  Will the audience scan the document or methodically read what you write?
-  Think of yourself as a teacher.
-  "Before readers can learn anything new, they have to see it in relation to something they already know." _The Craft of Scientific Writing: 3rd Ed. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1996. Print._

### Format
-  Writing style makes scientific writing accessible and useful. Decisions of style determine the effectiveness of scientific writing.

### Mechanics

_Mechanics_ refers to punctuation, grammar, citation format, footnote format, etc.

-  It's important to remember that language, written language included, is always and forever changing.

#### Style
-  Your duty to the audience is to be consice while also remaining accessible to the audience.
    -  Brevity and accessibility are in tension. Examples and analogies can help readers undertand at the cost of being brief. It's important to carefully balance these goals.
    -  A long terse list of facts will tire readers. It's important to bridge details and create a fluid document that avoids tiring readers.
-  Word choice
    -  Use words that your audience will be familiar with.
-  Sentence length
-  The use of numbers, equations, graphs, and abbreviations.
-  Clarity is of utmost importance.
    -  Avoid extraneous things
    -  Be precise
    -  Be direct
    -  Be explicit

The following snippet from _John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)_ is very poignent:

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:

>  1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.
>   2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.
>  3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

Restated, these principles might be listed:

1.  Composition
2.  Juxtaposition
3.  Abstraction


### Politics
-  Is the purpose informative, or pursuasive?
-  Honesty is important.
-  Politics are always and forever present and will affect how you write a document.
    -  Avoid black and white thinking with respect to political pressures.
    -  Consider ethical dilemmas that arise carefully. The magnitude of their importance / tension will vary widely --- it's up to you to decide where to make a stand and where to compromise.
-  It's important to consider and act on your ethical responsibilitiy.

#### Pursuasive
-  Start with undisputed facts.
-  Seek to work from undisputed facts towards conclusions using logic-based arguments step-by-step.
    -  Build credibility with the audience with each logic-based argument.
