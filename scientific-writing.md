> [Some] scientist and engineers seek absolutes in scientific writing; they mistakenly treat scientific writing as a science instead of a craft.

## Four major constraints
- Audience
- Format (of the document)
- Mechanics (of the document)
- Politics (of the document)

### Audience
-  Efficiency is key
    -  Convey the most information in the least amount of **reading time**.
        -  Avoid saving the best for last, instead position key points so they're quickly noticed.
    -  Build a bridge to your audience with language and analogies.
-  If your audience is a mix of managers and technical experts, decide which is the primary audience.
    -  One way to cope with a mixed audience is to write the document body for the more general audience while using footnotes and back matter to fill in the details for technical experts.
-  Use the concept of emphasis (and lack of emphasis) to highlight important points.
-  Facts alone are not enough, tell the story. It's not lying or dishonest, rather it's crucial for connecting with your audience.
-  Will the audience scan the document or methodically read what you write?

### Politics
-  Is the purpose informative, or pursuasive?

#### Pursuasive
-  Start with undisputed facts.
-  Seek to work from undisputed facts towards conclusions using logic-based arguments step-by-step.
    -  Build credibility with the audience with each logic-based argument.
